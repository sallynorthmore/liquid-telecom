# An SVG animation with playback options

A fairly straightforward SVG animation using the Bodymovin animation plugin.

The animation must be played over a server (local or otherwise) because of cross-domain issues loading the `data.json` file.

## Local Setup
* Clone the repo and `cd` into the directory
* Run `npm i` to install the Browsersync dependencies 
* Run `npm start` to start a local server 
* Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## Browser Support
